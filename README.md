# C867-Roster
This project is part of my coursework for C867 at Western Governors University. It is a C++ program designed to manage a roster of students.  This project demonstrates my understanding of object-oriented programming, data structures, and file parsing in C++.

##Student Roster Management System
This program includes functionalities to:
-Add new students to the roster
-Remove students from the roster
-Print student details
-Validate email addresses
-Calculate the average number of days in courses
-Parse student data from input strings

##Features
-Add Students: Dynamically adds new students to the roster.
-Remove Students: Removes students from the roster by their student ID.
-Print Details: Prints detailed information about each student.
-Validate Emails: Checks and lists invalid email addresses.
-Average Days in Course: Calculates and prints the average number of days a student spends in courses.
-Parse Data: Parses student data from strings and populates the roster.

##Files
